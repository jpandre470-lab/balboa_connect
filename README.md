# Balboa Connect - Home Assistant custom component

</span>


**Balboa Connect** for Home Assistant is a custom integration designed to control and monitor Balboa BP-equipped spas via the Balboa BW50350 Wi-Fi Module or compatible TCP modules on port 4257.

## Technical Documentation

### Protocol Overview
- **Communication Protocol:** Binary socket protocol on port 4257
- **Message Checksum:** CRC-8 validation (polynomial 0x07, initial value 0xb5, final XOR 0x02)
- **Status Updates:** 0x13 message type containing 28-32 bytes depending on spa model
- **Command Types:**
  - `0x11`: Toggle commands (pumps, lights, blower, etc.)
  - `0x27`: Preference updates (temperature scale, clock mode, cleanup cycle, reminders, M8 AI)
  - `0x2d`: Lock configuration (panel lock, settings lock)
  - `0x1d`: Standby mode control

### Entity Protocol Mapping

| Entity | Message Type | Parameter | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Pumps 1-6, Lights, Blower, Mister, Aux | 0x11 | Toggle code | Direct on/off switching |
| Temperature Scale | 0x27 | [0x01, value] | 0=Fahrenheit, 1=Celsius |
| Clock Mode | 0x27 | [0x02, value] | 0=12hr, 1=24hr |
| Cleanup Cycle | 0x27 | [0x03, value] | 0=Off, 1-8=30-240min intervals |
| Reminders | 0x27 | [0x04, value] | Service reminder toggle |

| Panel Lock | 0x2d | [0x01, value] | Locks front control panel |
| Settings Lock | 0x2d | [0x02, value] | Locks preference menu |
| Standby Mode | 0x1d | Toggle code | Master heating enable/disable |
| Heating State | 0x13 | Byte 10, bits 4-5 | 0=Off, 1=Heating, 2=Heat Waiting |
| Temperature Range | 0x13 | Byte 10, bit 2 | 0=Low (50-80°F), 1=High (80-104°F) |


### Configuration Flow
1. Connect to spa module on port 4257
2. Receive initial 0x13 status message
3. Parse all state variables and create Home Assistant entities
4. Maintain background read loop for status updates
5. Send keep-alive heartbeat every 30 seconds
6. Process user commands and send appropriate messages with CRC-8 validation

✓ = Tested and working properly
